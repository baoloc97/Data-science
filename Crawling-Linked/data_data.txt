Regardless of whatever happens to the future of software, the people who are outstanding in their profession will continue to be in demand and will keep rising. I personally do not see any other industry which can offer better salaries to such a large group of people. Software is here to stay and it is not going anywhere.

But the fact which many are missing is that software industry (like other industries) is also about supply and demand, the demand of engineers being high as of now and jobs are everywhere.

Title : Software Engineer - Full Stack Developer
Member : 1.6K members
Detail : 1.	Server, Network, and Hosting Environment.
A.	This involves understanding what can break and why, taking no resource for granted.
B.	Appropriate use of the file system, cloud storage, network resources, and an understanding of data redundancy and availability is necessary.
C.	Full stack developers can work side by side with DevOps. The system should provide useful error messages and logging capabilities.  
2.	Data Modeling
A.	Full stack developers know how to create a reasonably normalized relational model, complete with foreign keys, indexes, views, lookup tables, etc.
B.	Full stack developers are familiar with the concept of non-relational data stores and understand where they shine over relational data stores.
3.	Business Logic
A.	The heart of the value the application provides.
B.	Solid object oriented skills are needed here.
C.	Frameworks might be needed here as well.
4.	API layer / Action Layer / MVC
A.	Full stack developers have the ability to write clear, consistent, simple to use interfaces. The heights to which some APIs are convoluted repel me.
5.	User Interface
A.	Full stack developers: a) understand how to create a readable layout, or b) acknowledge they need help from artists and graphic designers. Either way, implementing a good visual design is key.
B.	Can include mastery of HTML5 / CSS.
C.	JavaScript is the up and coming language of the future and lots of exciting work is being done in the JavaScript world (node, backbone, knockout…)
6.	User Experience
A.	Full stack developers appreciate that users just want things to work.
B.	Full stack developers write useful error messages. If something breaks, be apologetic about it. Sometimes programmers inadvertently write error messages that can make people feel stupid.
7.	Understanding what the customer and the business need.

A.	Full stack developers have a grasp of what is going on in the field when the customer uses the software. They also have a grasp of the business.
